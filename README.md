## TODO
- Finish auto file re-load on checksum change detection
- Handle File>Open operation when a file is already opened in the program
- SaveToFile can fail if file is in use by other program. Determine what to do here. Should we warn user and just keep attempting to save on each input change?
- Left-click and drag for mass toggle
- Right-click and drag for mass write (starting cell value is written to all cells dragged over)
- Middle-click and drag a stick cell to change value? Is this useful?
- Branching
- Bookmarks
